Summary: Cranmer elected a Fellow of the APS
 


Kyle Cranmer has been elected as a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS) 

*For the development of sophisticated statistical tools and concepts, and their application  to the successful search for the Higgs boson and measurements of its properties.*

"The number of APS Fellows elected each year is limited to no more than one half of one percent of the membership.  It is a prestigious recognition by your peers of your outstanding contributions  to physics," writes Sylvester James Gates, Jr., APS President. 

Congratulations Kyle!

It was an exciting time for the group. You can read more about it from the point of view of former student Sven Kreiss on his blog: [remembering his thesis](https://www.svenkreiss.com/blog/phd-thesis/), [the New York Times article](https://www.svenkreiss.com/blog/chasing-the-higgs-nyt/), and [a party we held at NYU covered in the New Yorker](https://www.svenkreiss.com/blog/nobel-prize-party-new-yorker/).
